/**
Given a set of items, each with weight and benefit, determine the items to include in the knapsack 
so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given weight limit and the total benefit is maximized. 
For example, if we are given following four items with their corresponding weights and benefits which items 
should we include in the knapsack to maximize the benefit. The weight limit for this knapsack is 10?
 
Item    1	2	3	4
Weight	2	2	4	5
Benefit	3	7	2	9
 
Weight=10, Profit=19, Items included: 1,2,4.


Time Complexity is O(weight*N), N=no of items
