/**
After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will 
not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house 
is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the 
previous street.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money 
you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
